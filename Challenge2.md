# Challenge 2 - Connect to API-M Instance

## Description
For this challenge, you've seen this done before.  Now it is time to bring your API into the API-M environment.  If you enabled an OpenAPI definition on your funciton this will be a short session.  If not, then you can still get there, but a few more manual steps are in store for you.

Don't forget to uniquely name the API so it does not class with your classmates.  This is in the naming as well as the url.

## Success Criteria
Your coach will access the function API through API-M and verify the results via the url you provide.

# Challenge 0: Pre-requisites and Setup

## Description
To support the challenges in this session, we need to install this small database in the Azure environment.  This database will be used to provide data to the functions created in this challenge.

In Azure, create an Azure SQL database.  
The database will be named "ServerlessChallenge".  
The database admin user and password are at the discretion of the installer.  However, this information must be shared with the participants, as well as the connection string.  
Participants should also have access to this resource in case they need to change firewall properties for developing locally.

This repository contains a setup folder with a sql script to populate the database.  Once the database is available in Azure, run the query using the Query Editor in the Azure Portal.  

## Success Criteria
Database is created, populated with data and available to the participants to access.

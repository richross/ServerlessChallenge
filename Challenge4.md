# Challenge 4: Monitor Function App

## Description
Monitoring deployed workloads is an important component of the DevOps process.  In this challenge, you will enable monitoring of your function app through the AppInsights dashboard.  You will also be able to view the logs for the function app and write queries against the logs using KQL.

* Enable AppInsights for your function app.
* View the LiveStream to see communication with your service in real time.
* View the application architecture to see the function app and its dependencies.
* Remove or modify the connection string from the function app and view the resulting errors in the LiveStream and Application Architecture
* Implement an outside in availability test to verify the function app is working.

## Success Criteria
AppInsights is enabled for your function app.  
You can see realtime traffic and application architecture for your function app.
Breaking the function app connection string results in an error in the LiveStream and Application Architecture.
You can monitor the availability of your function app.

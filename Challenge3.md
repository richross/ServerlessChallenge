# Challenge 3: Display APIs in Developer Portal

## Description
One of the important aspects of API-M environmnet is the availability of a developer portal.  This portal provides both internal and external users with information about the APIs you have created.  It also allows for trying out and subscribing to these APIs.  However, APIs are not displayed on the developer portal by default.  You must take steps to share them.

In order to provide some security around your APIs, you only want to share your APIs with authenticated users.  

## Success Criteria

Your coach will access the developer portal as an authenticated user and verify the APIs are displayed.
